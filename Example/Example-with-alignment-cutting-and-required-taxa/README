Example with alignemnt cutting:

This is a small example with alignment cutting.

Alignment cutting requires a whole genome and an annotation file.
These are usually very large, so I extracted only a few scaffolds and the relevant parts of the
annotation to the files in the Nvit-genome folder.

With the latest version of BaitFisher, the example analysis can be run with the command in the
runner file.
